## 🎯 Quick Start (Build & Run)

```bash
./run.sh --run        # Runs in BIOS (Legacy) mode
./run.sh --run --uefi # Runs in UEFI (Modern) mode
```

## 📋 Overview
Jarvis OS is a comprehensive educational operating system kernel designed to teach modern x86_64 architecture principles, memory management, process scheduling, and AI integration. Built entirely in C with minimal assembly, it provides hands-on experience with real OS concepts including boot sequences, interrupt handling, virtual memory, and filesystem implementation.

### Key Highlights
- **From Scratch**: No external kernel frameworks—everything built for educational clarity
- **Modern Boot**: Supports both legacy BIOS and UEFI with Multiboot 2 specification
- **AI-Ready**: Integrated LLM engine with NLP intent mapping in the kernel shell
- **Practical Testing**: Runs on modern x86_64 systems, VirtualBox, and QEMU

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Design
- **Mode**: 64-bit Long Mode (x86_64) with proper privilege levels
- **Boot**: Hybrid ISO supporting both BIOS and UEFI (Multiboot 2 compliant)
- **Memory Layout**: 
  - Kernel mapped to higher half (8GB boundary) for security isolation
  - 4GB identity mapping fallback for compatibility
  - Proper page table structure with 4-level paging

### Interrupt & Execution Model
- **Advanced APIC / IO-APIC logic** for modern CPU interrupt routing
- **PIC disabled** in favor of modern APIC architecture
- **Global Descriptor Table (GDT)**: 64-bit segments for kernel and user space
- **Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)**: Full exception and hardware interrupt handling

### Memory Management
- **Physical Memory Manager**: Bitmap-based allocation for efficient memory tracking
- **Virtual Memory Manager**: Full 4-level paging implementation with protection
- **Kernel Heap Allocator**: Dynamic memory allocation for kernel structures
- **Page Protection**: Proper access control and fault handling

### Process & Scheduling
- **Scheduler**: Round-robin scheduling for fair process execution
- **Process Context**: Full process state management and switching
- **Interrupt Safety**: Proper context preservation across interrupts

### Storage & Filesystem
- **ATA PIO Driver**: ATA Programmed I/O for disk communication
- **FAT32 Filesystem**: Full FAT32 support for disk operations
- **Boot Integration**: Filesystem accessible from bootloader and kernel

### Device Support
- **Framebuffer**: Hybrid BIOS/UEFI framebuffer support for graphics
- **Keyboard Driver**: Full keyboard input handling and event processing
- **Video Driver**: Virtio-VGA graphics support for modern virtualization
- **Display**: Terminal-based output with graphics capability

### AI Integration
- **LLM Engine**: Embedded AI brain for advanced shell capabilities
- **NLP Intent Mapping**: Natural language processing for command interpretation
- **Intelligent Shell**: Context-aware command processing and suggestions
